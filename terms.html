        <section class="legal-content">
            <p>Effective Date: January 15, 2026</p>

            <h2>1. Usage License</h2>
            <p>By purchasing Cleanmails, you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the script for
                personal or commercial projects. You may not resell, redistribute, or sub-license the source code in its
                original or modified form.</p>

            <h2>2. Self-Hosted Nature</h2>
            <p>Cleanmails is a self-hosted tool. You are responsible for providing the environment (hardware, operating
                system, runtimes) needed to execute the script. We are not responsible for server costs or maintenance.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>Due to the digital nature of the product (source code access), refunds are generally not provided once
                the download link has been accessed. However, if you encounter technical issues that we cannot resolve,
                please contact support.</p>

            <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>Cleanmails is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We are not liable for any damages resulting
                from the use or inability to use the script, including but not limited to loss of data or banned email
                sender accounts.</p>

            <h2>5. Updates</h2>
            <p>Lifetime access includes free updates to the version of the script purchased. Major new version releases
                may require a separate purchase at our discretion.</p>
