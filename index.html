                <p>Email marketing is only effective if your messages actually reach the inbox. High bounce rates and
                    spam reports don't just waste your time—they destroy your sender reputation and get your account
                    banned.</p>
                <p>Most validation services charge per email or require monthly subscriptions. This means you’re either
                    overpaying for infrequent cleanings or hesitating to validate your list as often as you should.</p>
                <p>Cleanmails is a lightweight, self-hosted script designed to give you full control. It validates your
                    email lists locally, checking syntax and verifying mail servers without sending a single email.</p>

                    <h2>🛡️ The 8-Step Validation Process</h2>
                    <p>When you run an email through Cleanmails, it undergoes a deep "Multi-Layered Scan" to ensure it
                        is safe for your sender reputation:</p>

                            <h3>1. Strict Syntax Check</h3>
                            <p>Verifies the email structure against RFC standards (proper @ placement, valid characters,
                                and length limits for both local and domain parts).</p>

                            <p>Uses Cloudflare’s DNS-over-HTTPS to verify if the domain actually exists and is active.
                            </p>

                            <p>Specifically checks if the domain has "Mail Exchange" records configured to receive
                                emails. An email with no MX records is 100% undeliverable.</p>

                            <p>Performs a cryptographic hash check against Gravatar. If a profile exists, the email is
                                marked as "High Confidence" because a real human has linked it to a social account.</p>

                            <p>Cross-references the domain against a database of 500+ temporary email providers (like
                                Mailinator or 10MinuteMail) that are often used for fraud.</p>

                            <p>Identifies generic addresses like admin@, support@, or info@. These are "Risky" for
                                outreach because they usually reach a group, not a decision-maker, and have higher
                                complaint rates.</p>

                            <p>Uses a custom algorithm to calculate the "randomness" of the local part. If an email
                                looks like xjh23_9sb@, it is flagged as a likely robotic or machine-generated address.
